# Emotion-Detection
This project uses deep learning to detect human emotions from facial expressions. A CNN model is trained on seven categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. Preprocessing ensures accuracy, and the trained model (Model.h5) can be deployed in apps for healthcare, education, and smart systems.
